                    Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has 
                    roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over
                        2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney 
                        College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur,
                        from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical 
                        literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 
                        1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) 
                        by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular
                        during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor 
                    amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32. and make up the bulk of the card's content.</p>
